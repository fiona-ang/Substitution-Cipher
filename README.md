# Substitution Cipher Algorithm
This Python program allows users to encrypt and decrypt plain texts/messages using a simple substitution algorithm. The substitution algorithm replaces each letter in the plaintext with a random substitution key.

# Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the substitution.py file.
2. Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

# Usage
1. Open a command prompt or terminal window.
2. Navigate to the directory where substitution.py is located.
3. Run the command python substitution.py to launch the program.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to encrypt or decrypt your message.

# Encrypting a message
To encrypt a message, you will need to provide a plaintext message. The program will replace each letter in the plaintext with the corresponding letter in the key, creating the ciphertext.

# Decrypting a message
To decrypt a message, you will need to provide the ciphertext. The program will replace each letter in the ciphertext with the corresponding letter in the key, revealing the original plaintext.
